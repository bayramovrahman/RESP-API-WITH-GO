# RESTful API WITH GO

This project is a **RESTful API** developed using **Go (Golang)**. The goal of the project is to create fast, scalable, and secure APIs by leveraging the power of Go. The API is built using the **Gin framework**, which makes the development process more efficient.

## 🌐 RESTful API Development – Go: The Complete Guide
